## âœ… **Email Configuration Fixed!**

The email issue has been resolved:

### **ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed:**

1. **Updated App Password**: Changed to the new 16-character password you provided: `fybd ubpf qytm wuef`
2. **Removed Duplicates**: Cleaned up duplicate email configurations in .env file
3. **Fixed Authentication**: SMTP authentication test passed successfully âœ…

### **ðŸ“§ Current Email Settings:**
- **SMTP Server**: smtp.gmail.com:587
- **Username**: owenzcolin@gmail.com  
- **Password**: New 16-character app password (working âœ…)
- **Encryption**: TLS enabled

### **ðŸš€ Next Steps:**

**You need to restart your Flask backend server** to load the new email credentials:

1. **Stop the current backend** (Ctrl+C in the terminal running the Flask app)
2. **Restart the backend** with:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Colin\Desktop\cynthia\backend
   python app.py
   ```

### **ðŸ§ª Test Results:**
The standalone email test confirmed that the SMTP authentication is working correctly with the new credentials.

### **ðŸ“± After Restarting:**
1. Go to your registration page
2. Try registering a new user
3. You should now receive the email verification code successfully!

The registration flow should now work perfectly:
- âœ… Register new user
- âœ… Receive OTP email (working now!)
- âœ… Verify email with OTP code
- âœ… Complete registration process

**The email system is ready to go! Just restart the backend server.** ðŸŽ‰
